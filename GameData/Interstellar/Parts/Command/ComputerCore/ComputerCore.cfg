description = A very large supercomputing system. Can be upgraded to an AI Core capable of generating a small amount of science per day (depending on location) as well as operating the gravity lens experiment with an attached IR telescope and a sufficient supply of cryogenic helium. It requires 1200 science points to upgrade a specific active computer core to an AI core. It is unknown if it will open the pod bay doors.
